    <h3 class="md-title">Shop at your convenience, collect your order and don't pay for delivery</h3>
    <p>You can shop fast and efficiently in our online store at any time. You can favourite items you buy frequently to make it easy to find them next time. Want to read more about that ginger sauce you just bought? Filter the store by your last order. Or feel free to browse our categories. Many of our products are seasonal and we have new producers joining all the time so it's worth keeping an eye on our store's selection.</p>

    <h3 class="md-title">Pick Up, Don't Pay for Delivery</h3>
    <p>Your order will be available for collection on Tuesdays at 22 Bank Street, CBD Whangarei. When you pick up, delivery costs aren't added to our prices, passing the savings directly to you.</p>

    <h4 class="md-title">Alternate Pickup Locations</h4>
    <p>If picking up in the Whangarei CBD is not convenient for you, just <a href="/contact">let us know</a>. We'll arrange for a member near you to collect your order, and bring it to your neighbourhood for you to pick up. All at no extra cost.</p>
    <p>If there are no other members near you, your order can also be delivered by courier. Just  <a href="/contact">ask us</a> about courier delivery. We'll invoice you for the courier cost, which varies based on the size of your order and where you live.</p>

    <h4 class="md-title">Fridge and Freezer Transport</h4>
    <p>Whether you're picking up or receiving delivery, you can rest assured your chilled and frozen goods will remain fresh and safe. We use ChillTainers for pickup and courier boxes, providing 6-8 hours of chilling without the aid of a refrigerated truck.</p>

    <h3 class="md-title">Know Whatâ€™s In Your Food, Where It Came From, And How It Was Grown</h3>
    <p> All our food is GE free, free-range and made or grown in Northland. Produce is always spray-free, and many of our growers are completely organic. If a producer is certified organic, an organic certification badge appears on their products.</p>
    <p>When producers join us, they declare any and all chemicals they use. Our standards committee then decides whether or not to bring them onboard. We have never approved someone using synthetic pesticides.</p>
    <p>Producers have a <a ui-sref="directory" target="_blank">profile page</a> where they share their production methods and stories.</p>

   <h3 class="md-title">Be Part Of Our Vibrant Community Of Food Lovers And Growers</h3>
   <p>You can call or email our producers directly to learn more  about their products. You can also share tips, ideas and suggestions on our message board. After signing up you'll receive regular email reminders and updates about what we're up to.</p>
