<p>Advanced tips:</p>
<ul style="text-align:left">
  <li>Not all our produce is organic, but it is at minimum spray-free. Click on any product to learn more about it. If the answer you're looking for isn’t in the product description, scroll down to the producer's summary and view their profile. You might find more about their growing methods. If not, you can always contact them to find out.</li>
  <li>Some products need to be ordered earlier than others. The website will alert  you if something you order won’t be available in time for the next delivery day.</li>
  <li>Click the clock icon near the top right of the catalog to see your last order. If you tend to order the same things each week, this is the easiest way to find what you like.</li>
  <li>Clicking the heart on products will favourite them. If the product you've liked needs extra notice for ordering, you'll get an email reminding you to order it on the last day it's available for that week.</li>
  <li>When viewing a product in detail, you can click to see all products from the same producer.</li>
  <li>The search bar searches by name only. If you get no results, try an alternate spelling like "carrot" instead of "carrots".</li>
  <li>Add products to your cart by clicking the cart button. To increase the quantity, click the same button again or type in the quantity field.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can pay for your order by credit card or PayPal. Contact us about loading your account with balance if you'd prefer to pay by store credit.</p>

<p>Our current only pick up location is {{coopAddress}} from {{coopHours}} every {{coopDayString}}.</p>
