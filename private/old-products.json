Once you've finished enjoying your delicious local milk, please wash out the empty bottles and return them to the NNFC sorting centre on delivery day. We're always looking for more to reuse.\n\nWe understand that a number of our customers would prefer glass bottles. This currently isn't practical for us, as we transport large volumes of milk over bumpy roads in the back of our truck. Glass bottles clanking together would cause breakage and spills, so we use recycled plastic instead. But if you'd like to have one of your own containers filled with our yummy milk, please contact us. We might be able to work something out for you.\n\nYou can collect your order directly from the farm gate if preferred. Contact us if this is the case, otherwise milk will be delivered to The Natural Food Coop sorting centre on delivery day. You can also contact us about special bulk prices on our milk for cheese making etc. If you need a large volume, we may be able to offer you a discount.\n\n*We're confident that our milk is safe to drink.
