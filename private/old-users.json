We are heading toward self-sufficiency through our gardens, food forest (orchards), house cow, beefies and birds... and sharing the abundance seasonally.</span>  \n\nUsing organic, sustainable and permaculture practices, we produce and sell:\n\n*   A wide variety of seasonal vegetables\n*   Seasonal fruits and berries\n*   Organic, pastured eggs \n*   Organic, free-ranging duck eggs\n*   Interesting and exotic herbs and more (stinging nettle anyone? white strawberries? Malabar gourds?)\n\n#### **Practices**\n\n**Weed Control**: hoeing, manual cultivating (wheel hoe) and mulch! For gorse we use acetic acid (ie vinegar), chainsaws, free-ranging poultry\n\n**Inputs:** fish fertiliser, seaweed, cow manure and organic compost, natural mineral supplements (e.g. gypsum)\n\n**Tillage:** rotary spading (helps prevent compaction) and man-powered wheel hoe\n\n**Animal Husbandry:** well-loved animals given organic food (certified organic grains, organic veggie scraps, etc), pasture to roam on/graze. Babies (calves, chicks, ducklings) are kept with mum as long as she'll have them (don't be surprised if you see a two-year old steer going in for a sip at our place). Chooks are kept in a large fenced yard that is moveable. They are moved to fresh pasture regularly, as needed. They are also left to completely free-range in the late afternoon in the summer months. Ducks free range most of the day, coming back to their yard at night.\n\n**Certification:** We plan to look into becoming a certified-organic operation within the next 24-months, as our business gets rolling. In the meantime, we welcome visits to our location and questions from our customers about our practices. Feel free to ask other organic producers in the Whagarei area who know us, as well.","personalBio":"#### **Matt Stanley**\n\n<div>![](http://www.northtec.ac.nz/getmedia/1dec60dd-7acd-4ab2-947c-7eb8a8a6510b/horticulture-Matthieu-Stanley-003.jpg.aspx?widthremoved=270&heightremoved=270&ext=.jpg&width=160)</div>\n\n<div>\n\nis a 22-year-old graduate of NorthTec in horticulture who specialised in Sustainable Rural Development and Permaculture.

have been organic over 30 years now in Maungatapere and used to be biodynamic registered.  The avocados are in retirement but some trees still produce lovely tasting fruit.  We leave them on the trees for longer as we usually pick gradually and later.  The kiwifruit is still in full production during the winter months, these we leave on the vines longer to bring up the sugar levels since we don't export our quality is high and we have no need to pick early.  The lemons are available in winter and through some of summer months when they are sweeter from being on the tree for so long.  There are passionfruit available in summer months, although also in retirement.  Sorry no gate sales, only through this website and at the growers market in the winter.","personalBio":"","companyName":"25 Years

We do not pasteurize, super filter or cream our honey. Our honey is extracted in a centrifuge and strained at low temperature in small batches to help retain enzymes yeasts and pollens which produces a pure raw honey. Each batch of Miere Honey is laboratory tested to comply with MPI regulations and is then packed in 350g recyclable glass jars.","personalBio":"","companyName":"Miere Honey Ltd","logo":"upload/producer-logos/Miere Honey Ltd+id-56cfb866f2fe22f913af1090.jpg","bankAccount":"38-9012-0844092-00"},"user_type":{"name":"Producer","canBuy":true,"canSell":true},"addressPermission":true,"regionID":[],"dateJoined":"2016-02-26T00:00:00+1300","__v":0,"routeTitle":"East to Ngunguru"},{"_id":"56d36fe4f2fe22f913af10cb","name":"Denny Clayton","email":"dennyorganics@gmail.com","phone":"9493555555","address":"Northland, New Zealand","lat":-35.5795461,"lng":173.7624053,"badges":[],"useBusinessBalance":false,"businessBalance":0,"balance":-48.6,"routeManager":{"townsOnRoute":[]},"producerData":{"bankAccount":"NO ACCOUNT ON RECORD","description":"We sell organic veggies at growers markets all across Northland.\n\nYou'll find our stall at the Whangarei growers market, kerikeri and paihia markets.\n\nWe have lots of organic potatoes this year and very competitive prices. \n\nJust a note: I am not very tech savvy so please don't send me emails.","personalBio":"","companyName":"Denny's Organics"},"user_type":{"name":"Producer","canBuy":true,"canSell":true},"addressPermission":false,"regionID":[],"dateJoined":"2016-02-29T00:00:00+1300","__v":0},{"_id":"56d5ed45f2fe22f913af10d3","name":"Rodney Clarke and Catherine Oakley, Winsam Farm Sheep Cheese","email":"tranquilitybase@wc.net.nz","phone":"(09) 4019870","address":"192 Lodore Rd, RD1, Okaihau.  0475","lat":-35.3207348,"lng":173.7702724,"badges":[],"useBusinessBalance":false,"businessBalance":0,"balance":0,"routeManager":{"townsOnRoute":[]},"producerData":{"bankAccount":"NO ACCOUNT ON RECORD","description":"","personalBio":""},"user_type":{"name":"Producer","canBuy":true,"canSell":true},"addressPermission":false,"regionID":[],"dateJoined":"2016-03-02T00:00:00+1300","__v":0},{"_id":"56d861f00c6e202710cfc4de","name":"Elif Intel","email":"elifintel@hotmail.com","phone":"04 389 7098","address":"Wellington, New Zealand","lat":-41.2864603,"lng":174.776236,"badges":[],"useBusinessBalance":false,"businessBalance":0,"balance":-30,"routeManager":{"townsOnRoute":[]},"producerData":{"bankAccount":"NO ACCOUNT ON RECORD","description":"","personalBio":""},"user_type":{"name":"Customer","canBuy":true,"canSell":false},"addressPermission":false,"regionID":[],"dateJoined":"2016-03-04T00:00:00+1300","__v":0,"resetPasswordExpires":"1457533601972","resetPasswordToken":"62527cccb5fbb45e22899db18c3aa63fa1bb5332"},{"_id":"56e01cd80c6e202710cfc4ff","name":"Denise Donald","email":"graemedenisedonald@gmail.com","phone":"021410333","address":"Taihoa Road, Parua Bay, New Zealand","lat":-35.7769813,"lng":174.4861972,"badges":[],"useBusinessBalance":false,"businessBalance":0,"balance":-109.58199956000001,"routeManager":{"townsOnRoute":[]},"producerData":{"bankAccount":"NO ACCOUNT ON RECORD","certification":"none","chemicalDisclaimer":"None","description":"","personalBio":""},"user_type":{"name":"Producer","canBuy":true,"canSell":false},"addressPermission":false,"regionID":[],"dateJoined":"2016-03-10T00:00:00+1300","__v":0}]
